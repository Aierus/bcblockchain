<h1> Our Mission - Educate </h1>

<text> BC Blockchain is a student-run, educational and professional organization seeking to educate other students on blockchain technology. We incorporate hands-on learning with industry expert speaking engagements, educational workshops, and ongoing projects to market cryptocurrencies within the student body.

In an increasingly digital world, where more people have access to the internet than ever before, financial institutions must take the blockchain revolution seriously. Throughout the fall semester, we focus on bringing industry knowledge of blockchain technology, and its applications, to the Boston College community. In the spring semester, we shift that focus towards cryptocurrencies and the skills that will help students capitalize on the full potential of this technology. We feel that to properly understand how cryptocurrency markets work, you must first strive to understand the underlying technology behind them. It is our mission to enable the students of today to become the blockchain employees of tomorrow.

BC Blockchain is the club for every Boston College student. This technology is being embraced by the financial world, and will be a critical piece of our society moving forward. Thus, it should be a topic that career-minded Boston College students should be paying attention to. Blockchain ecosystems are changing, and growing, every single day, and to truly understand the technology you must continually monitor the industry. Our club offers students the opportunity to learn the skills they need to succeed in the industry and connect them with industry experts that can further help them establish a career in the space.

BC Blockchain strongly believes in the future of blockchain technology, as well as its extensive range of use cases, and we hope that you join us. In its current state, the industry is a set of embers waiting to burst into flame, it is our job to be the spark.
