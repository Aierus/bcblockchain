<h1> Oct 4 8:30 PM - Intro to Cryptocurrency </h1>

Join BC Blockchain for our first event as we welcome back Justin Gregorius, Protocol Specialist at a16z, and Matt Batsinelas, Partner at Triblock. Justin and Matt founded the club back in 2017 and are both great resources for learning more about the crypto space. If you've heard about crypto and want to see what all the hype is about, this will be the perfect setting to develop a broad understanding of blockchain basics.

If you have any questions, feel free to put them in [this form](https://bcblockchain.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8ef15f950e6118c012c96f58e&id=37e520867b&e=0886d80cfc) and we will try to get to them. If you think your question in too simple or stupid, please ask it - that is exactly what this event is for! There also might be time for a Q & A at the end. We hope to see all of you there!
