<h1> Wed 7:00 - Recurring Weekly Meetings </h1>

[Zoom Link](zoom.us/tbd)

We'll be holding weekly discussion meetings on Wednesday nights. We will do a market-wrap for the week, cover any new developments, and engage in discussion with club members on any crypto-related topic. Keep an eye on your email for the zoom links, which will also be updated here.


<h1> Nov 1 8:00PM - Q&A with Professor Bennett Collen </h1>


<h1> Oct 19 6:30PM - DeFi and NFT Crash Course </h1>
Wondering what's the best fiat on-ramp into DeFi? How to deposit into a liquidity pool? How to buy an NFT from a marketplace or mint one when it drops? Join us for an on-chain crash course on DeFi and NFTs. We will walk through all of the steps needed to onboard into the scary world of web3 and go over best practices in order to safely and confidently interact with blockchains and their applications.

<h1> Oct 12 7:30PM - Intro to DeFi and NFTs Event </h1>

Join BC Blockchain as we welcome back Tom Pierce, Sales Development Representative at Stripe, and Kel Eleje, Independent Researcher at the Messari Hub. Tom and Kel were co-presidents of the club last year and are both actively involved in DeFi and NFT spaces. This will be a great opportunity to learn more about what sort of projects are being built on the blockchain and how they can disrupt various industries. It will also serve as a baseline of knowledge for our following DeFi and NFT crash course event, where we will walk through setting up a MetaMask and interacting with various DeFi and NFT protocols.

<h1> Oct 4 8:30 PM - Intro to Cryptocurrency </h1>

Join BC Blockchain for our first event as we welcome back Justin Gregorius, Protocol Specialist at a16z, and Matt Batsinelas, Partner at Triblock. Justin and Matt founded the club back in 2017 and are both great resources for learning more about the crypto space. If you've heard about crypto and want to see what all the hype is about, this will be the perfect setting to develop a broad understanding of blockchain basics.
